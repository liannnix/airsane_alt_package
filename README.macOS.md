# macOS build instructions
Building AirSane on macOS is quite similar to building on Linux but
requires either MacPorts or Homebrew to provide the necessary dependencies.

## Build AirSane using MacPorts
If you have not done so, install MacPorts as described here:
https://www.macports.org/install.php

Then, open a terminal and `cd` to a location that will hold your AirSane
source directory.

There, execute the following commands:
```
sudo port install sane-backends jpeg libpng
sudo port install cmake
git clone https://github.com/SimulPiscator/AirSane.git
mkdir AirSane-build && cd AirSane-build
cmake  ../AirSane
make
sudo make install
sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.simulpiscator.airsaned.plist 
```

If everything went well, a window may pop up, asking whether to allow
the program `airsaned` to listen on the network. Click "Allow".

Now, whenever you plug in an USB scanner that is recognized by `scanimage -L`, 
it will also be available in Apple Image Capture, Preview, and other applications
that rely on Apple's ImageCapture framework.

If your scanner is not recognized by `scanimage -L`, you might need to enable
its backend in `/opt/local/etc/sane.d/dll.conf`.

There, you may also disable unused backends by prepending with a `#` in order
to speed up device search.

## Build AirSane using Homebrew
If you have not done so, install Homebrew as described here:
https://brew.sh/

Then, open a terminal and `cd` to a location that will hold your AirSane
source directory.

There, execute the following commands:
```
brew install sane-backends jpeg libpng
brew install cmake
git clone https://github.com/SimulPiscator/AirSane.git
mkdir AirSane-build && cd AirSane-build
cmake  ../AirSane
make
sudo make install
sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.simulpiscator.airsaned.plist 
```

If everything went well, a window may pop up, asking whether to allow
the program `airsaned` to listen on the network. Click "Allow".

Now, whenever you plug in an USB scanner that is recognized by `scanimage -L`, 
it will also be available in Apple Image Capture, Preview, and other applications
that rely on Apple's ImageCapture framework.

If your scanner is not recognized by `scanimage -L`, you might need to enable
its backend in `/usr/local/etc/sane.d/dll.conf`.

There, you may also disable unused backends by prepending with a `#` in order
to speed up device search.
